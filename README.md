# Background

This is a repository that I used to learn about ROS and to explore different topics in ROS. Not all of the exploration produced tangible results, but some did.

# Setting Up ROS From the Beginning
This section will teach you how to setup ROS to be able to use this repository.

If you have installed all of the necessary packages, then you may skip this section.

## Installing ROS
To use this repository, you will want to install [Ubuntu 18](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/).

Next you will need to install [Ros Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu). Follow the instructions for installation provided by the ROS wiki.
